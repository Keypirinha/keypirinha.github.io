How to Report an Issue
======================

An |bugtracker_link| accepts any issue report or suggestion related to the
application or an official :term:`package`.

Here are some guidelines to report an issue. Please follow them! To accurately
report an issue strongly increases the chances of your issue to be fixed
quickly.

* Ensure your are running the latest version of |project|

* Search if your issue has been reported already

* Check if some warning/error message has been printed on the :term:`Console`

* One bug per report

* Describe the issue clearly, in English. Bullet points are good

* Provide step-by-step instructions so we can reproduce the issue (we can't fix
  what we can't reproduce).

  - What steps will reproduce the problem?
  - What is the expected output/behavior?
  - What do you see instead?

* Optionally attach screenshots so we can "see" the issue

* Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome


.. _contribute-packages:

Get involved in the development of the Packages
===============================================

If you are not sure where to start from, some feature requests or issues
reported by users may be associated with the `help-appreciated
<https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-appreciated>`_
tag.

The |packsrepo_link| is online and accepts *Pull Requests*.


.. _contribute-platform:

Get involved in the development of the Platform
===============================================

|project| is looking for an involved developer to help creating its online
platform dedicated to the automated redistribution of plugins (i.e. website and
service).

**The project**

* Code would be fully open source
* It mainly consists of a website and a service to be accessed by |project|
  itself
* It will include current |project|'s website (documentation)
* Its main language would be Python3
* It must run on a Linux platform

**About you**

* You want to improve |project|
* You want to spend some of your free time on a long run project
* You are of the kind who like to get the job done
* You are willing to enter a friendly online relationship with an other
  developer for the good of a project :)

**Application**

Please PM `@polyvertex <https://gitter.im/polyvertex>`_

*@polyvertex* is a former long-term traveler who values humanized and friendly
online relationships between developers. Having a beer (or five) with him
somewhere, someday, will be part of the deal :)
