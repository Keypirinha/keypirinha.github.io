Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

What is |project|
=================

.. include:: common/what.rst


Why a new Launcher?
===================

There are already existing launchers for Windows out there and we have tried a
lot of them before deciding to develop |project|. Including the inspiring
*Synapse*, which unfortunately supports Linux only.

They are either not keyboard-only oriented, not flexible enough, not always
extensible, too bloated, too slow or just outdated (implying a broken support of
recent platforms).

|project| has been started as a personal project and is not meant to be better
than all of them. It offers a recent alternative that is fast, flexible, memory
efficient, battery friendly and smarter about the search results it provides.

By *battery friendly*, we mean that with the default configuration and plugins,
|project| consumes zero CPU cycle once it has been initialized and not used
(i.e.: most of its lifetime).

That being said, by design, its graphical user interface (GUI) is (very)
minimalistic and supports functional tweaking only. Also, its learning curve can
be more steep, depending on how you want to use it and extend it. That makes
|project| quite a *niche* project, mostly addressed to advanced users.


Any translation?
================

Currently, |project| is available in English only and there are no plan to
support additional languages in a near future. For now, we prefer to focus on
bug fixing and the implementation of new features.
