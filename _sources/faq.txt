Why a new Launcher?
===================

There are already existing launchers for Windows out there and we have tried a
lot of them before deciding to develop |project|. Including the inspiring
*Synapse*, which unfortunately supports Linux only.

They are either not keyboard-only oriented, not flexible enough, not always
extensible, too bloated, too slow or just outdated (implying a broken support
for recent platforms).

|project| has been started as a personal project and is not meant to be better
than all of them. It offers a recent alternative that is fast, flexible, memory
efficient, battery friendly and smart about the search results it provides.

By *battery friendly*, we mean that with the default configuration and plugins,
|project| consumes zero CPU cycle once it has been initialized and when not used
(i.e. most of its lifetime).

That being said, by design, its graphical user interface (GUI) is (very)
minimalistic and supports functional tweaking only. Also, its learning curve can
be more steep, depending on how you want to use it and extend it. That makes
|project| quite a *niche* project, mostly addressed to advanced users.


So... A replacement to the Start Menu?
======================================

Many people who have not tried |project| (or sometimes any other keystroke
launcher), tend to think that it's just about being a replacement to the Start
Menu, the system's Search feature, or even just organized shortcuts and batch
scripts.

It would be a mistake to think of |project| as an application launcher only.
|project| itself is very **generic**. It is just a database of *items* sweetened
with a small search engine. In other words, it can launch any kind of task
provided by its plugins. May it be a document, a URL, creating an alarm at a
given time, launching a web search, directly launching a FileZilla session,
switching to a running application using its name, evaluate a mathematical
expression inline, ...

Its whole architecture is about being generic, configurable and scriptable
(Python3_). And its search engine also tries to be smarter and to give better
score to tasks that you most likely want to launch given the current search
terms and context.

Generally speaking, a launcher like |project| may deeply impact your everyday
work-flow.


Is it open source?
==================

The application itself is not and is distributed as a
`Freeware <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware>`_. |br|
Its official plugins are open source and will always be.

As of August 2016, project status is not meant to change in a short-term future
in that regard. However, there is a strong will to make the project
community-oriented through the development of an open and automated packages
management platform.


How to support the project?
===========================

You can show your support to the |project| project by:

* Spreading nice words about it!
* Giving the project a **Like** or a **Star**: |br|

Where does this weird name come from?!
======================================

Keypirinha is combined from combining the terms Keyboard and Caipirinha, the
brazilian cocktail, which the author really encourages you to try if you haven't
yet!


Any translation?
================

Currently, |project| is available in English only and there is no plan to
support additional languages in a near future. For now, we prefer to focus on
bug fixing and the implementation of new features.
