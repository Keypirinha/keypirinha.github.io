Current Developments
====================

Here are the headlines of |project|'s current developments.

**Open Packages Platform:** |project| is glad to welcome `@psistorm`_ as a
project member! He is currently working on developing the online side of the
project in order to make it more **community-oriented**. That includes
|project|'s website and more importantly a **packages management platform** to
allow users to easily search, list, install, update and uninstall official and
third-party packages. **Third-party developers** will be able to share their
package with the community by registering their GitHub_ or Bitbucket_
repository.

**Catalog sub-system:** Several features regarding the Catalog sub-system have
been requested by users and have been hanging in the issue tracker for quite a
while now (issues `#22`_, `#52`_ and `#60`_). Altogether, they imply deep
changes under the hood and require some time to be implemented. It is slowly
making its way.
