Installation
============


.. warning::
    Go to the :doc:`update` chapter if |project| is already installed and you
    just want to update.


Requirements
============

|project| works on Windows (7, 8, 8.1, 10) and does not require extra
dependencies.


Installation
============

|project| currently comes in a simple archive that can be uncompressed about
anywhere you want. There is no installer.

Out of the box, it is configured to run in :ref:`install-portable`. All the
configuration and runtime files are contained under |project|'s directory.

.. note::
    It is recommended to avoid installing |project| under your Desktop or Start
    Menu folder as you will loose the benefits of having your catalog
    automatically refreshed when an application gets (un)installed.


Installed vs. Portable mode
===========================

|project| can run in two different flavors: :ref:`install-installed` or
:ref:`install-portable`.

Each time |project| is being launched, it checks if the :file:`portable` folder
or the :file:`portable.ini` file exist under |project|'s directory. If they do,
the application will run in :ref:`install-portable`, otherwise the
:ref:`install-installed` is selected.

.. note::
    There is currently no automated way to ease switching between the two modes
    so you will have to copy the directories manually if you wish to switch to
    the :ref:`install-installed`. **Please ensure first that the application is
    not running.**


.. _install-portable:

Portable Mode
-------------

The Portable Mode keeps all the files needed by |project| in a single folder,
making it easy to be moved around on a USB stick for example.

By default, all the data files of |project| and its plugins will be located
under the :file:`portable` directory, directly located in |project|'s
directory:

* Configuration files and downloaded extra packages will be stored in
  :file:`portable\\Profile`
* Cache files and any other kind of temporary files will be stored in
  :file:`portable\\Local`

Optionally, it is also possible to specify the location of the content of
the :file:`portable` directory by creating a :file:`portable.ini` file in
|project|'s directory (i.e. same directory than :file:`keypirinha.exe`) and
define the ``portable_dir`` value in it. |br|
Here is a sample :file:`portable.ini` (only the ``portable_dir`` line is
needed):

.. code-block:: ini

    # Notes:
    # * The specified directory must exist already when Keypirinha is started
    #   and it must be readable and writable by Keypirinha
    # * If the path is not absolute, it is assumed to be relative to
    #   Keypirinha's directory
    # * In this example, both sub-directories will be created automatically by
    #   Keypirinha if needed:
    #     C:\SomewhereUnderTheRainbow\KeypirinhaData\Profile
    #     C:\SomewhereUnderTheRainbow\KeypirinhaData\Local
    # * It does not have to be named KeypirinhaData
    # * File must be encoded in UTF-8 (no BOM necessary)
    portable_dir = C:\SomewhereUnderTheRainbow\KeypirinhaData

.. note::
    * The :file:`portable.ini` file takes precedence over the presence of the
      :file:`portable` directory
    * The :file:`portable` directory may be removed if you are using a
      :file:`portable.ini` file
    * To avoid any trouble with your data, |project| will exit immediately if
      any error occurs related to this setting.


.. _install-installed:

Installed Mode
--------------

The Installed Mode complies to the Windows' standard way of storing data under
user's dedicated folder (e.g. :file:`C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%`).

* Configuration files and downloaded extra packages will be stored in
  :file:`%APPDATA%\\Keypirinha` folder. |br|
  e.g. :file:`C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Keypirinha`
* Cache files and any other kind of temporary files will be stored in
  :file:`%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Keypirinha` |br|
  e.g. :file:`C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Keypirinha`

.. warning::
    In order to be able to run under this mode, both :file:`portable` and
    :file:`portable.ini` must **not** exist in |project|'s directory.
