Shipped Packages
================

For convenience, |project| is shipped with some :term:`packages`, also called
*Official Packages* that are enabled by default.

|project| is a very generic tool and these *Shipped Packages* might not fit your
needs entirely so they have been open-sourced to allow a maximum degree of
flexibility. Feel free to modify them and to extend their features.

Note that it is also possible to contribute to their development so everyone can
take advantage of the improvements you applied. Read the
:ref:`contribute-packages` section if you want to get involved.

Some |project| users already have shared their packages and modifications to the
community. Check out the :doc:`contributions` chapter for more info.
