What is |project|
=================

Why a new Launcher?
===================

There are already existing launchers for Windows out there and we have tried a
lot of them before deciding to develop |project|. Including the inspiring
*Synapse*, which unfortunately supports Linux only.

They are either not keyboard-only oriented, not flexible enough, not always
extensible, too bloated, too slow or just outdated (implying a broken support
for recent platforms).

|project| has been started as a personal project and is not meant to be better
than all of them. It offers a recent alternative that is fast, flexible, memory
efficient, battery friendly and smart about the search results it provides.

By *battery friendly*, we mean that with the default configuration and plugins,
|project| consumes zero CPU cycle once it has been initialized and when not used
(i.e. most of its lifetime).

That being said, by design, its graphical user interface (GUI) is (very)
minimalistic and supports functional tweaking only. Also, its learning curve can
be more steep, depending on how you want to use it and extend it. That makes
|project| quite a *niche* project, mostly addressed to advanced users.


So... A replacement to the Start Menu?
======================================

Many people who have not tried |project| (or sometimes any other keystroke
launcher), tend to think that it's just about being a replacement to the Start
Menu, the system's Search feature, or even just organized shortcuts and batch
scripts.

It would be a mistake to think of |project| as an application launcher only.
|project| itself is very **generic**. It is just a database of *items* sweetened
with a small search engine. In other words, it can launch any kind of task
provided by its plugins. May it be a document, a URL, creating an alarm at a
given time, launching a web search, directly launching a FileZilla session,
switching to a running application using its name, evaluate a mathematical
expression inline, ...

Its whole architecture is about being generic, configurable and scriptable
(Python3_). And its search engine also tries to be smarter and to give better
score to tasks that you most likely want to launch given the current search
terms and context.

Generally speaking, a launcher like |project| may deeply impact your everyday
work-flow.


Is it open source?
==================

The application itself is distributed as a
`freeware <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware>`_. |br|
Its official plugins are
`open source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license>`_.

How to support the project?
===========================

|project| is distributed for free and you are absolutely not required to
participate in any way, so please do not feel that you *have to*.

However, the application itself and the official packages are the result of
several hundreds of hours of development spent by a single person so if you do
wish to show your support, please know that it is greatly appreciated and taken
as an encouragement for future developments.

There are several ways to support |project|:

* Make a donation |br|
  |donate_button|

* *Like* it, *Star* it, spread nice words about it |br|
  |social_buttons|

* :ref:`contribute-doc`

* Help to develop the official packages |br|
  :ref:`contribute-packages`

* There are plans to develop an automated packages redistribution platform |br|
  :ref:`contribute-platform`


How my donation will be used?
=============================

All donations will be used for the project.

Small donations will probably be spent on coffee to cheer up the developer in
his cave. Bigger amounts will be spared for:

* a Windows 10 license, which would help in the development of some requested
  features
* the domain name
* the hosting of the dynamic website and the packages redistribution platform
  that is planned
* a digital certificate for signing |project|'s binaries so users can ensure
  the ones they installed can be trusted to be issued by the original author
* some hardware used in the development of the project

Where does this weird name come from?!
======================================

Keypirinha is a combination from the terms Keyboard and Caipirinha, the
brazilian cocktail, which the author really encourages you to try if you haven't
yet!


Any translation?
================

Currently, |project| is available in English only and there is no plan to
support additional languages in a near future. For now, we prefer to focus on
bug fixing and the implementation of functional features.
