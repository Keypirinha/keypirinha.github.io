Why a new Launcher?
===================

There are already existing launchers for Windows out there and we have tried a
lot of them before deciding to develop |project|. Including the inspiring
*Synapse*, which unfortunately supports Linux only.

They are either not keyboard-only oriented, not flexible enough, not always
extensible, too bloated, too slow, unstable, or just outdated (implying a broken
support for recent platforms).

|project| has been started as a personal project and is not meant to be better
than all of them. It offers a recent alternative that is blazing fast, flexible,
memory efficient, battery friendly and smart about the search results it
provides.

By *battery friendly*, we mean that with the default configuration, |project|
consumes zero CPU cycle once it has been initialized and when not used (i.e.
most of its lifetime).

However, by design, its graphical user interface (GUI) is minimalistic and its
learning curve may feel steep to some, depending on how you want to use it and
extend it. **That makes of Keypirinha quite a niche project, mostly addressed to
advanced users.**


So... A replacement to the Start Menu?
======================================

Many people who have not tried |project| or any other keystroke launcher are
tempted to think it is just about being a replacement to the Start Menu, or the
:kbd:`Win+S` feature, or even just some organized shortcuts and scripts.

It would be a mistake to think of |project| as an application launcher only.
|project| itself is very **generic**. It is just a database of *items* sweetened
with a small search engine. In other words, it can launch any kind of task
provided by its plugins. May it be a document, a URL, creating an alarm at a
given time, launching a web search, directly launching a PuTTY or a FileZilla
session, switching to a running application using its name, evaluate a
mathematical expression inline, ...

Its whole architecture is about being generic, configurable and scriptable
(Python3_). Its search algorithm tries to be smarter by giving a better score to
tasks that you most likely want to launch given the current search terms and
context.

A launcher like |project| may deeply impact your everyday work-flow. You may
even find yourself
`missing it <https://twitter.com/Paratron/status/884451322736644096>`_!


Is it open source?
==================

In short, the application itself is not, its official plugins are.

The application itself is distributed as a `freeware
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware>`_ (see the :doc:`license`).
In other words, |project| is distributed for free and there is no time limit, no
nag screen, no ad.

Its official plugins that are shipped with it are `open source
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license>`_ and published under the
terms of the `zLib license
<https://github.com/Keypirinha/Packages/blob/master/LICENSE>`_, a permissive
license.


Is it Beta software?
====================

No, |project| can be considered stable.

|project| is used by a small but involved community that has shown itself
reactive in reporting issues and interacting with the developer. As a result,
maintenance releases are usually pushed pretty fast if a severe issue is
reported.

How to support the project?
===========================

|project| is distributed for free and you are absolutely not required to
participate in any way, so please do not feel that you *have to*.

However, the application itself and the official packages are the result of
several hundreds of hours of development spent by a single person so if you do
wish to show your support, please know that it is greatly appreciated and taken
as an encouragement for future developments.

There are several ways to support |project|:

* Make a donation |br|

Where does this weird name come from?!
======================================

Keypirinha is a combination from the terms *Keyboard* and *Caipirinha*, the
brazilian cocktail, which the author really encourages you to try if you haven't
yet!


Any translation?
================

Sorry, there is no plan to support additional language in a near future.
