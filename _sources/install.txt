Installation
============


.. warning::
    If |project| is already installed and you just want to update, go to the
    :doc:`update` chapter.


Requirements
============

|project| works on Windows 64bits (7, 8, 8.1) and does not require additional
dependencies. It hasn't been tested on Windows 10 but should work just fine.

There is no plan in a near future to support 32bits platforms.


Installation
============

|project| currently comes in a simple archive that can be uncompressed about
anywhere you want. There is no installer.

**Out of the box**, it is configured to run in :ref:`install-portable`, which
means all the configuration and runtime files are stored in a single folder,
located under |project|'s directory.


Installed vs. Portable mode
===========================

|project| can run in two different flavors: :ref:`install-installed` or
:ref:`install-portable`.

Each time |project| is being launched, it checks if a :file:`portable` folder
exists under |project|'s directory. In that case, the application will run in
:ref:`install-portable`, otherwise the :ref:`install-installed` is selected.

.. note::
    There is currently no automated tool to ease switching between the two modes
    so you will have to copy the directories manually if you wish to switch to
    the :ref:`install-installed`. **Just ensure first the application is not
    running.**


.. _install-installed:

Installed Mode
--------------

The Installed Mode complies to the Windows' conventional way of storing
applications' data under user's dedicated folder. Usually something like:
:file:`C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%`.

The configuration files and downloaded extra packages will be stored in the
:file:`%APPDATA%\\Keypirinha` folder.
That might be translated to something like that on your machine:
:file:`C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Keypirinha`.

Runtime files and any other kind of temporary files will be stored in the
:file:`%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Keypirinha` folder.
That might be translated to something like that on your machine:
:file:`C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Keypirinha`.

.. warning::
    In order to be able to run under this mode, the :file:`portable` directory
    must **not** exist. So be sure you have deleted it after copying your files
    to their new locations.


.. _install-portable:

Portable Mode
-------------

The Portable Mode keeps all the files needed by |project| in a single folder,
making it easy to be moved around on a USB stick for example.

The configuration files and downloaded extra packages will be stored in the
:file:`portable\\Profile` folder, directly located in |project|'s directory.

Runtime files and any other kind of temporary files will be stored in the
:file:`portable\\Local` folder, directly located in |project|'s directory.
