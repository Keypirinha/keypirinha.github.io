Architecture
============

This section provides some insights about |project|'s design and philosophy.

Overview
========

|project| by itself is just a database (the :term:`Catalog`) sweetened with a
small adaptive search engine and a straightforward graphical interface. Thus,
**the task of feeding the Catalog is entirely left to its** :term:`Plugins`.

From that point of view, we can say that the whole architecture of |project|
depends on its :term:`plugins`. They are responsible of finding :term:`items` on
your computer, like applications, documents and bookmarks for example, as well
as offering to evaluate mathematical expressions, monetary conversions and so
on...

These :term:`items` are created by the *plugins* and are then sorted and stored
in an internal database called the :term:`Catalog`, to make making them quickly
searchable and easily executable.

Configuration
=============

By design, to configure |project| and its packages requires to edit
configuration files manually. There is no graphical interface to do that.
|project| uses the ``ini`` file format to read, and it **only reads** its
configuration.
