Update Procedure
================


If |project| is not installed on your machine yet. You should head over to the
:doc:`install` chapter instead.

|project| does not come with an installer yet so the update procedure must be
done manually.

.. warning::
    You must first ensure |project| is not running!

    To exit |project|, you have two options:

    * Fire up the :term:`LaunchBox` and search-then-execute the
      ``Keypirinha: Exit`` item.
    * Use the ``Exit`` item of the main contextual menu. To get the contextual
      menu, right-click of |project|'s icon in the system tray, or
      right-click directly on the :term:`LaunchBox`.

Once you have ensured |project| is not running, the procedure depends on whether
you chose the :ref:`install-installed` or the :ref:`install-portable`.

.. tip::
    To check which mode |project| is running in, open its install directory and
    check if the :file:`portable` directory exists. If it does, you are in
    :ref:`install-portable`.


Update in Installed Mode
========================

* Open |project|'s install directory |br|
  :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` for example |br|
  Ensure there is **no** :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable` directory

* Delete it |br|
  It is safe to do so. In this mode, your configuration files are stored in your
  Home folder (i.e. under :file:`%APPDATA%\\Keypirinha`)

* Open |project|'s distribution archive |br|
  Its name should be something like :file:`keypirinha-x64-portable.7z`

* Extract its content to :file:`U:\\` |br|
  You should now have a :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` directory

* Delete the :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable` directory |br|
  So |project| knows it must run in Installed Mode

* You're done |br|
  You may now execute the :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\keypirinha.exe` file

.. warning::
    Be sure to read the section below about :ref:`update-overpacks`.


Update in Portable Mode
=======================

* Open |project|'s install directory |br|
  :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` for example |br|
  Ensure there **is** a :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable` directory

* Delete everything in :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` **except**
  :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable` (this is where your configuration files are
  located)

* Open |project|'s distribution archive |br|
  Its name should be something like :file:`keypirinha-x64-portable.7z`

* Extract its content to :file:`U:\\` |br|
  It is OK to overwrite the dummy file :file:`portable\\KEEPME`

* You're done |br|
  You may now execute the :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\keypirinha.exe` file

.. warning::
    Be sure to read the section below about :ref:`update-overpacks`.

Overridden Shipped Packages
===========================

If you have modified some official package, you may want to ensure their code,
their resources **and** the nomenclature of their default configuration files
hasn't changed!

If you run into trouble with an official package, try first to move away its
loose folder to check if your issue is reproducible.
