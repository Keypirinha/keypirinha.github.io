Update Procedure
================


If |project| is not installed on your machine yet. You should head over to the
:doc:`install` chapter instead.

|project| does not come with an installer yet so the update procedure must be
done manually.

.. warning::
    You must first ensure |project| is not running!
    This is because it keeps open some of its files at runtime so you would not
    be able to modify/delete them...

    To exit |project|, you have two options:

    * Fire up the :term:`LaunchBox` and search-then-execute the
      ``Keypirinha: Exit`` item.
    * Use the ``Exit`` item of the main contextual menu. To get the contextual
      menu, right-click of |project|'s icon in the system tray, or
      right-click directly on the :term:`LaunchBox`.

Once you're sure |project| is not running anymore, the procedure depends on
whether you chose the :ref:`install-installed` or the :ref:`install-portable`.

.. tip::
    To check in which mode |project| is, open its install directory and check
    for a :file:`portable` directory. If it is there, you are in
    :ref:`install-portable`.


Update in Installed Mode
========================

* Open |project|'s install directory. |br|
  :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` for example. |br|
  Ensure there is **no** :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable` directory!

* Delete it. |br|
  Don't worry. In this mode, your configuration files are stored in your Home
  folder (i.e. under :file:`%APPDATA%\\Keypirinha`).

* Open |project|'s distribution archive (its name should be something like
  :file:`keypirinha-x64-portable.7z`).

* Extract its content to :file:`U:\\`. |br|
  You should now have a :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` directory.

* Delete the :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable` directory. |br|
  That indicates |project| it must run in Installed Mode.

* You're done! |br|
  You may now execute the :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\keypirinha.exe` file. |br|
  It might be named :file:`keypirinha` in your *Windows Explorer* view, so to
  recognize it, it is the one with the squared-K icon.

.. warning::
    Be sure to read the section below about :ref:`update-overpacks`.


Update in Portable Mode
=======================

* Open |project|'s install directory. |br|
  :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` for example. |br|
  Ensure there **is** a :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable` directory!

* Delete everything in :file:`U:\\Keypirinha` **except**
  :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\portable`. |br|
  Don't mess up with this one, this is where your configuration files are
  located!

* Open |project|'s distribution archive (its name should be something like
  :file:`keypirinha-x64-portable.7z`).

* Extract its content to :file:`U:\\`. |br|
  It is safe to anwser yes to the ``Overwrite?`` question concerning the
  :file:`portable` directory since it is just about replacing a dummy file (i.e.
  :file:`KEEPME`).

* You're done! |br|
  You may now execute the :file:`U:\\Keypirinha\\keypirinha.exe` file. |br|
  It might be named :file:`keypirinha` in your *Windows Explorer* view, so to
  recognize it, it is the one with the squared-K icon.

    Be sure to read the section below about :ref:`update-overpacks`.

Overridden Shipped Packages
===========================

If you have modified some official package, you may want to ensure their code,
their resources **and** the nomenclature of their default configuration files
hasn't changed!

If you run into trouble with an official package, try first to move away its
loose folder to check if your issue is reproducible.
