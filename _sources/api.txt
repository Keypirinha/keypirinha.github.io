Extending |project| (API)
=========================

|project| offers a flexible way to be extended by embedding a Python3_
interpreter and exposing some of its core features via an API and two Python
modules named :py:mod:`keypirinha` and :py:mod:`keypirinha_util`.

Before reading further, you may want to get familiar with the :doc:`packages`
section to picture how |project| loads and interprets its packages and their
plugins, as well as the subtleties between the different types of packages.
