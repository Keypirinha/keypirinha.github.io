=========================
Extending |project| (API)
=========================

|project| offers a flexible way to be extended thanks to its embedded Python3_
interpreter and its exposed Python API through Python modules:
:py:mod:`keypirinha`, :py:mod:`keypirinha_util` and :py:mod:`keypirinha_net`.

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is available that comes with a small battery of
tools to help you through the process of creating your own plugin. You can grab
it from here: |sdkrepo_link|

Before reading further, you may want to get familiar with the :doc:`packages`
section to picture how |project| loads and interprets its packages and their
plugins, as well as the subtleties between the different types of packages.
