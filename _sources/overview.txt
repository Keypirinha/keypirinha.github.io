Overview
========

This section provides some insights about |project|'s design and philosophy.


Architecture
============

You can see |project| as a small search engine that indexes a selection of items
found in your computer and makes them a breathe to find and
execute/open/...

The whole architecture of |project| depends on its :term:`plugins`. They are
responsible of finding items on your computer, like an application or a document
for example.

Those :term:`items` are created by the plugins, sent to the application, and are
then sorted and stored in an internal database called the :term:`catalog`,
making them quickly searchable and easily executable.


Packages and Plugins

Configuration
=============

By design, to configure |project| and its packages requires to edit
configuration files manually. There is no graphical interface to do that.
|project| uses the ``ini`` file format to read, and **only read** its
configuration.
