Apps Package

The *Apps* package finds the main applications and executable files installed on
your computer and makes them available from |project|'s :term:`Catalog`.


Catalog Items
=============

This package populates the Catalog with the following items:

* Items from the Windows' Start Menu

* Executable files pointed by the ``PATH`` environment variable. The ``PATHEXT``
  environment variable is used to get the list of valid executable files.

* All the executable files referenced by the ``extra_paths`` setting in
  package's dedicated configuration file.
