    Catalog
        The Catalog is the name of the internal database of |project| where all
        the :term:`items` are indexed to allow a quick search.

    CatalogItem
        The class name of an :term:`item`.

    Console
        The Console window's purpose is two-fold. It gives you an overview of
        what happens under |project|'s hood. It also allows to check if a plugin
        emitted a informational/warning/error message.

    InstanceID
        The InstanceID number is an unsigned integer internally used by the
        application and assigned at runtime to every loaded :term:`package`. It
        is used to ensure Plugins are not messing up the :term:`catalog`.

        Read :doc:`api/overview` for more information.

    Item
    Items
        An item is a simple data structure created by the :term:`plugins` and
        that holds some properties like a display name (label), a category
        (File, URL, Command Line, ...), a reference to the parent
        :term:`plugin`, etc...

        The Item is also the smallest data unit of |project|'s internal
        database (the :term:`Catalog`).

    LaunchBox
        The L(a)unchBox is |project|'s main dialog window, from which you can
        make a search and launch the selected :term:`item`. It can be opened by
        pressing the :kbd:`Ctrl+Win+K` combination (by default).

    Package
    Packages
        A Package is a container of one or several :term:`plugins` and that
        represents a unique feature visible to the user.

        This container holds the source code of its plugins, their dependencies,
        a default configuration file, if any, and optionally some documentation.

        Its content can be stored in a directory or packed in an archive to ease
        its redistribution (i.e. a :file:`*.keypirinha-package` file, which is
        actually a regular zip archive).

        Read :doc:`packages` for more information.

    Plugin
    Plugins
        In the context of |project|, a Plugin is a software component written in
        Python3_ that extends the base features of the application. It is always
        encapsulated in a :term:`package`.

    Repository
    Repositories
        A Repository is a directory dedicated to the storage of
        :term:`packages`. It also defines the way Packages are stored (i.e.:
        loose files or packed in a single archive).
