How to Report an Issue
======================

An |bugtracker_link| accepts any issue report or suggestion related to the
application or an official :term:`package`.

Here are some guidelines to report an issue. Please follow them! To accurately
report an issue strongly increases the chances of your issue to be fixed
quickly.

* First search if your issue has already been reported

* Provide the exact and complete version number of the application. You can get
  it by displaying the *Console* dialog (scroll up to the top lines)

* One bug per report

* Describe the issue clearly, with simple language, in English (bullet points
  are good)

* Provide step-by-step instructions so we can reproduce the issue (we can't fix
  what we can't reproduce).

  - What steps will reproduce the problem?
  - What is the expected output/behavior?
  - What do you see instead?

* Optionally attach screenshots so we can "see" the issue

* Optionally attach the complete log of the session during which the bug
  occurred (the log indicates critical information including the complete
  version number). |br|
  Note that you may want to strip the log file first since it may contain
  several sessions.

* Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome

Get involved in the development of the Official Packages
========================================================

The Official Packages repository is not open yet, but do not hesitate to submit
suggestions on the |bugtracker_link| or head over to the |webirc_en|, ou pour
les francophones : |webirc_fr|.

.. An |packrepo| is online and accepts any report issues related to the application
.. or an official package.
..
.. If you are interested in improving the existing official packages, or if you
.. wish to share new packages you have created and that you would like to see
.. integrated into the official distribution, the |packrepo| is open to patch
.. requests.
