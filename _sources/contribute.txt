How to Report an Issue
======================

An |bugtracker_link| accepts any issue report or suggestion related to the
application or an official :term:`package`.

Here are some guidelines to report an issue. Please follow them! To accurately
report an issue strongly increases the chances of your issue to be fixed
quickly.

* First search if your issue has already been reported

* Provide the exact and complete version number of the application. You can get
  it by displaying the :term:`Console` (scroll up to the top lines)

* One bug per report

* Describe the issue clearly, with simple language, in English (bullet points
  are good)

* Provide step-by-step instructions so we can reproduce the issue (we can't fix
  what we can't reproduce).

  - What steps will reproduce the problem?
  - What is the expected output/behavior?
  - What do you see instead?

* Optionally attach screenshots so we can "see" the issue

* Optionally attach the complete log of the session during which the bug
  occurred (the log indicates critical information including the complete
  version number). |br|
  Note that you may want to strip the log file first since it may contain
  several sessions.

* Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome


.. _contribute-packages:

Get involved in the development of the Packages
===============================================

If you are interested in improving an official package, the |packsrepo_link| is
online and accepts pull requests.


.. _contribute-platform:

Get involved in the development of the Platform
===============================================

|project| is looking for a skilled web developer to help creating its online
platform dedicated to the automated redistribution of plugins (i.e. website and
service).

**The project**

* Platform's code would be fully open source
* Its main language would be Python3
* It must run on a Linux platform
* It will include current |project|'s website (documentation)

**About you**

* You want to improve |project|
* You have a crystal clear view of the requirements for such a task
* You want to volunteer and spend some of your free time on a long run project
* You are of the kind who like to get the job done
* You are willing to enter a friendly online relationship with an other
  developer for the good of a project :)

**Application**

Please PM `@polyvertex <https://gitter.im/polyvertex>`_ and provide some info
about your background. Links to your code repositories are welcome.

*@polyvertex* is a former long-time traveler who values humanized and friendly
online relationships between developers. Having a beer (or five) with him
somewhere, someday, is a non-negociable requirement to your application :)
