How to Report an Issue
======================

An |bugtracker_link| accepts any issue report or suggestion related to the
application or an official :term:`package`.

Here are some guidelines to report an issue. Please follow them! To accurately
report an issue strongly increases the chances of your issue to be fixed
quickly.

* First search if your issue has already been reported

* Copy and paste the first lines of the :term:`Console`. They should look like
  this:

  .. code-block:: text

    22:27:30.915 Keypirinha 2.11 (66a575a) for x64
    22:27:30.915 System: WinNT-x64 6.3.9600-ws-0x0100
    22:27:30.915 Portable mode
    22:27:30.915 Keyboard layout: 0000040C
    22:27:30.915 Monitor #1: Name[\\.\DISPLAY1] Rect[0, 0, 1920, 1200] DpiScale[1.00] PRIMARY
    22:27:30.915 Monitor #2: Name[\\.\DISPLAY2] Rect[0, 0, 1024, 768] DpiScale[1.00]

* One bug per report

* Describe the issue clearly, with simple language, in English (bullet points
  are good)

* Provide step-by-step instructions so we can reproduce the issue (we can't fix
  what we can't reproduce).

  - What steps will reproduce the problem?
  - What is the expected output/behavior?
  - What do you see instead?

* Optionally attach screenshots so we can "see" the issue

* Optionally attach the complete log of the session during which the bug
  occurred (the log may reveal critical information to help tracking down the
  issue). |br|
  Note that you may want to strip the log file first since it may contain
  several sessions.

* Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome


.. _contribute-packages:

Get involved in the development of the Packages
===============================================

If you are not sure where to start from, some feature requests or issues
reported by users may be associated with the `help-appreciated
<https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-appreciated>`_
tag.

The |packsrepo_link| is online and accepts pull requests.


.. _contribute-platform:

Get involved in the development of the Platform
===============================================

|project| is looking for an involved developer to help creating its online
platform dedicated to the automated redistribution of plugins (i.e. website and
service).

**The project**

* Code would be fully open source
* It mainly consists of a website and a service to be accessed by |project|
  itself. Pretty much like `Package Control <https://packagecontrol.io>`_ for
  `SublimeText <http://www.sublimetext.com>`_, or
  `Packal <http://www.packal.org>`_ for `Alfred <https://www.alfredapp.com>`_
* It will include current |project|'s website (documentation)
* Its main language would be Python3
* It must run on a Linux platform

**About you**

* You want to improve |project|
* You have a crystal clear view of the requirements for such a task
* You want to spend some of your free time on a long run project
* You are of the kind who like to get the job done
* You are willing to enter a friendly online relationship with an other
  developer for the good of a project :)

**Application**

Please PM `@polyvertex <https://gitter.im/polyvertex>`_

*@polyvertex* is a former long-term traveler who values humanized and friendly
online relationships between developers. Having a beer (or five) with him
somewhere, someday, will be part of the deal :)
