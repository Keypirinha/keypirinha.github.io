How to Report an Issue
======================

An |bugtracker_link| accepts any issue report or suggestion related to the
application or an official :term:`package`.

Here are some guidelines to report an issue. Please follow them! To accurately
report an issue strongly increases the chances of your issue to be fixed
quickly.

* First search if your issue has already been reported

* Provide the exact and complete version number of the application. You can get
  it by displaying the :term:`Console` (scroll up to the top lines)

* One bug per report

* Describe the issue clearly, with simple language, in English (bullet points
  are good)

* Provide step-by-step instructions so we can reproduce the issue (we can't fix
  what we can't reproduce).

  - What steps will reproduce the problem?
  - What is the expected output/behavior?
  - What do you see instead?

* Optionally attach screenshots so we can "see" the issue

* Optionally attach the complete log of the session during which the bug
  occurred (the log indicates critical information including the complete
  version number). |br|
  Note that you may want to strip the log file first since it may contain
  several sessions.

* Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome
