To make :term:`Plugins` easier to distribute, |project| has been introduced the
concept of :term:`Packages`.

In |project|, a package is a container that groups one or several plugins
designed to work together, as well as optional configuration files and
dependencies.

A package can take the form of a directory containing loose files, or a Zip
archive with the :file:`.keypirinha-package` extension (for redistribution).
