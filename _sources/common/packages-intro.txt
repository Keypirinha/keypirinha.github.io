To make :term:`plugins` easier to redistribute, |project| has been introduced
the concept of :term:`Packages`.

In |project|, a package is a container (e.g.: a directory; or a Zip archive with
the :file:`.keypirinha-package` extension) that groups one or several plugins
designed to work together. It also contains the configuration files and
dependencies, if any.
