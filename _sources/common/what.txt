|project| is a semantic launcher for keyboard ninjas on Windows.

It is a very generic tool hand-crafted with love by a nerd for nerds that allows
to execute any kind of task using your keyboard only, by typing a small fraction
of its name. |br| May it be to start an application, to open a file, a web
bookmark, or more exotic tasks like evaluating a mathematical expression in-
line, or launching a *PuTTY*/*FileZilla*/*WinSCP* session directly, ...

It has been designed to allow lightning fast searches, to have a small memory
footprint and a file-driven configuration scheme. It is also battery friendly.

Finally, it is extensible by writing :term:`plugin` scripts in Python3_.
