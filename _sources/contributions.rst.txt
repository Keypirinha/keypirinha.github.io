How to Install
==============

Managed
-------

:ghu:`ueffel` wrote `PackageControl <https://github.com/ueffel/Keypirinha-PackageControl>`_,
a package manager that eases the install of third-party packages.

It must be installed manually.

Manual
------

Package developers usually offer a ready-to-install ``.keypirinha-package``
file.

If the package is hosted on GitHub, you may find it in the ``releases`` section:

.. image:: images/github-pack-repo.png
    :align: center


In the releases section, you usually want the most up-tu-date release marked as
``Latest release``. Locate it and grab the ``.keypirinha-package`` file
associated to it.

.. image:: images/github-pack-release.png
    :align: center


If no ``.keypirinha-package`` file is associated to the latest release, please
contact the package developer.

Once you have downloaded the ``.keypirinha-package`` file, simply move it to the
:file:`Keypirinha\\portable\\Profile\\InstalledPackages` folder if you are in
Portable mode, or to the :file:`%APPDATA%\\Keypirinha\\InstalledPackages` folder
in Installed mode.
