WebSearch Package
=================

Available since version 2.0.

Launch a search on any configured website using system's default web browser.

Some search sites are already configured by default. Currently: ``Bing``,
``DuckDuckGo``, ``Google``, ``Twitter``, ``Yahoo``, ``WolframAlpha``, ``IMDB``,
``Wikipedia``, ``YouTube``, ``C++``, ``CPAN``, ``Git``, ``PHP``, ``Python3`` and
``RubyGems`` (this list may vary).

Catalog Items
=============

This package populates the :term:`Catalog` with the following items:

* Items prefixed with ``WebSearch`` (one per configured site)


Configuring Search Sites
========================

*WebSearch* allows flexible and fine-grained configuration. Use the
``Configure Package: WebSearch`` item to edit it (check out the
:doc:`../configuration` chapter for an overview about how to edit |project|'s
configuration files).

For example, if you wish to be able to request the *DuckDuckGo* search engine
from |project| (which is already configured by default), add the following into
your configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [site/DuckDuckGo]
    url = https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s
    new_window = yes
    incognito = no
    history_keep = all

The first line start a new configuration section, the ``site/`` prefix is
required so *WebSearch* knows it is a new search site. The remaining part is the
name that will be used to create a new Catalog Item. The
``WebSearch DuckDuckGo`` item will be created in this example.

The ``url`` setting (**required**) can hold one *or* several URLs (one per
line). The URL must contain the search terms placeholder ``%s`` to indicate
*WebSearch* where to insert the search terms and how to url-encode them.

The ``new_window`` setting (optional) accepts a boolean value to indicate if a
search on this website should be launched in a new window.

The ``incognito`` setting (optional) accepts a boolean value to indicate if a
search on this website should be launched in *Private Mode* (also called
*Incognito* on *Chrome*).

The ``history_keep`` setting (optional) indicates if and how a search request on
this website should be kept in |project|'s History. It accepts the following
values:

    * ``all`` indicates that the targeted web site as well as the terms entered
      by the user for this particular search will be kept in history.

    * ``site`` indicates that only the targeted site will be kept in history,
      without the actual user's search terms.

    * ``none`` indicates that the search must not be kept in history at all.

.. note::
    Note that the ``new_window`` and ``incognito`` values are only hints. When
    you launch a search, |project| tries to detect system's default browser and
    insert the appropriate command line options according to the type of web
    browser (*Chrome*, *Firefox*, *Internet Explorer* and *Opera* are currently
    recognized). In the end, it is up to the browser to accepts these options
    or not.

An extra setting (``args_quoting``) is available to force *WebSearch* to
url-encode the search terms in a specific way before inserting them into the
final URL. By default, *WebSearch* detects in which part of the URL the
placeholder is located. Then encodes the search terms according to this
location. But some websites do not always follow the standard rules of encoding
and might behave unexpectedly. This setting accepts the following values:

    * ``auto`` (**default**) Choose the appropriate quoting scheme according to
      the position of the ``%s`` placeholder in the URL.

    * ``quote`` Replace special characters using the '%xx' escape. Letters,
      digits, and the characters ``_.-`` are never quoted.

    * ``quote_plus`` Like ``quote``, but also replace spaces by plus signs.


Multi-URL Search Site
---------------------

Example of multi-URL search site:

.. code-block:: ini

    [site/Multi]
    url =
        https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s
        https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%s

.. caution::
    Notice the indentation of the URLs!
