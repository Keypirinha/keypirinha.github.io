===================
FileBrowser Package
===================

Available since version 2.7.

The FileBrowser package allows to browse the file system as you type.


Catalog Items
=============

This package does not pre-create any item in the :term:`Catalog`. Instead, it
tries to match your initial search term with specific patterns:

* ``/`` or ``\`` will list the drives that are mounted (e.g. ``C:\``, ...)
* ``C:``, ``D:`` or ``X:`` (case insensitive) will start browsing the drive
  associated with the given letter
* An absolute path like ``c:\windows`` or ``D:\My Dir\AnyFile.txt``
* The ``~`` (tilde) character (**configurable**) to access to your "home"
  directory(ies). Check the "Home feature" section below.

.. note::
    Some items from the filesystem may or may not show up, depending on
    package's configuration. For more info, refer to the configuration file and
    check the ``show_dirs_first``, ``show_hidden_files``,
    ``show_system_files`` and ``show_network_files`` settings.

.. tip::
    While on Windows, convention is to use the ``\`` character, |project| also
    interprets ``/`` as a path separator.

.. tip::
    This package is :ref:`first-drag` compliant.


Home feature
============

The "home" feature allows you to get quick access to your favorite(s) folder(s)
by typing a given *trigger* of your choice (``~`` by default).

Check out package's configuration file for more details.

* To go deeper in the file system hierarchy, select a folder item in the results
  list and press ``TAB``.
