==================
Everything Package
==================

Query Everything_ from |project| to find and open any file or folder.

Available since version 2.3.


Requirements
============

Everything_ v1.3 or more recent must be running to do a search.

.. note::
    This package retries to find Everything instance each time you want to do a
    search so you can freely (re)start Everything whenever you need to.


Catalog Items
=============

This package populates the :term:`Catalog` with the following items:

* Search for the items prefixed with ``Everything:`` (by default). They are
  added to the Catalog even if Everything is not running at init time.

* The ``Search`` item allows to query Everything using its normal search syntax

* The ``Regex Search`` item allows to query Everything using its regular
  expression syntax

* The ``Rebuild DB`` item request Everything to rebuild its database (**requires
  Everything v1.4**).


Introduction
============

To query Everything from |project| allows you to take advantage of both
Everything's speed and |project|'s matching algorithm. Once you have
searched-found-executed a file/folder using this package, it is kept in
|project|'s history so you do not have to query Everything a second time to open
it.

.. tip::
    You can reduce the number of keystrokes even more to reach the same item by
    using the :ref:`first-associate-keyword` feature.


Troubleshooting
===============

If no item appear after a search query, ensure Everything is running and no
error message has been emitted by the plugin (check |project|'s
:term:`Console`).
