Internal Package
================

``Internal`` is the only package that is not visible on the filesystem as it is
implemented in the application itself. It gives access to some core features of
|project| by populating the :term:`Catalog` with special items that all have got
the ``Keypirinha:`` prefix.

Here are some of the items that the ``Internal.About`` plugin populates:

* ``Keypirinha: Configure Application`` to edit application's configuration
  file(s)
* ``Keypirinha: Refresh Catalog`` to ask all packages to refresh their catalog
* ``Keypirinha: Refresh Catalog: <Package Name>`` to ask a single package
  to refresh its catalog
* ``Keypirinha: Console`` to show the :term:`Console` window
* ``Keypirinha: About`` to see application's ``About`` dialog box
* ``Keypirinha: Exit`` to quit |project|

.. tip::
    The best way to list all the items populated by this plugin is to type the
    ``keypirinha:`` string in the :term:`LaunchBox`.
