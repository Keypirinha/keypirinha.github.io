==================
RegBrowser Package
==================

Available since version 2.9.6

Browse and open Windows Registry keys directly from |project|

Examples or recognized entries:

  * ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software``
  * ``CURRENT_USER\Software``
  * ``HKCU\Software``
  * ``hkey_local_machine\system\CURRENTCONTROLSET``
  * ``hklm\SYSTEM/currentcontrolset/``
  * ``HKLM``

A Registry key is recognized as such by the plugin if and only if the specified
path is absolute (i.e. starting with one of the ``HKEY_`` values) **and** the
specified key exists **and is readable** (i.e. right access privileges), at the
moment you are typing it.

.. note::
    * ``/`` character is also supported as separator in addition to ``\``
    * Paths are case-insensitive
