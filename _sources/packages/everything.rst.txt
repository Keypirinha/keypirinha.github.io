==================
Everything Package
==================

Available since version 2.3

Query Everything_ (a **separate** tool) from |project| to find and open any file
or folder.

.. note::
    * If you are looking for a way to browse the file system as you type a path,
      check out the :doc:`filebrowser`
    * If you are looking for a way to catalog files you frequently use, check
      out the :doc:`filescatalog`


Requirements
============

Everything_ v1.3 or more recent must be running to do a search.

.. note::
    This package retries to find *Everything* instance each time you want to do
    a search so you can freely (re)start *Everything* whenever you need to.


Catalog Items
=============

By default, this package populates the :term:`Catalog` with the following items:

* The ``Everything: Search`` item (default name) allows to query *Everything*
  using its normal search syntax

* The ``Everything: Regex Search`` item (default name) allows to query
  *Everything* using its regular expression syntax

* The ``Everything: Rebuild DB`` item request *Everything* to rebuild its
  database (**requires Everything v1.4**).


Usage
=====

To query *Everything* from |project| allows you to take advantage of both
*Everything*'s speed and |project|'s matching algorithm. Once you have
searched-found-executed a file/folder using this package, it is kept in
|project|'s history so you do not have to query *Everything* a second time to
open it.

.. tip::
    You can reduce the number of keystrokes even more to reach the same item by
    using the :ref:`first-associate-keyword` feature.

.. tip::
    Remember you can drag the resulting items the same way you would drag files
    to/from the Windows Explorer, in order to copy files or create shell links
    for example. See the :ref:`first-drag` section for more info.


Troubleshooting
===============

If no item appear after a search query, ensure *Everything* is running and no
error message has been emitted by the plugin (check |project|'s
:term:`Console`).
