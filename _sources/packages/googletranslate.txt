=======================
GoogleTranslate Package
=======================

Available since version 2.10

Suggest translations using Google Translate online service, to/from any
supported language.


Usage
=====

By default, a ``Translate`` item is inserted into the Catalog using the default
source and target language parameters provided by the configuration file.

Select the item and type the term(s) you wish to translate as item's argument.

The plugin then queries the Google Translate service and adds the result as a
suggestion in the results list.

The default action when pressing the :kbd:`Enter` key is to copy the result to
the clipboard. Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Enter` for a list a available actions related to
this result.


Custom Items
============

If you wish to have more "translate" items available with different predefined
language parameters, it is possible to define extra items in the configuration
file by declaring ``custom_item`` sections.

Refer to the default configuration file of the package for more information.

.. seealso::
    The :doc:`../configuration` chapter


Search Grammar
==============

For translation queries that do not necessitate the creation of custom items, it
is possible to change the language parameters on-the-fly, at search time,
without having to modify the configuration file.

To do so, select **any** item created by this plugin and to use one of following
grammars as its argument::

    A. <terms>
    B. [[lang_in]:[lang_out]] <terms>
    C. <terms> [[lang_in]:[lang_out]]

Examples::

   1. fr:en Bonjour
   2. :es Danke
   3. en: Hello world
   4. hello world en:
   5. Que tal? -:en

Grammar ``A`` being the most basic, it fully relies on the source and target
languages used to create the item that is currently selected (may it be the
*default* item or a *custom* one).

Grammar ``B`` and ``C`` both allow to override item's language code(s).

Example ``2`` forces the target language to be Spanish, but keeps the source
language of the currently selected item.

Examples ``3`` and ``4`` are equivalent and secure the source language to be
English.

Example ``5`` requests the translation of ``Que tal?`` from the ``auto``
language (Google will interpret this sentence as being Spanish) to English.

.. tip::
  * The placement of the ``:`` character matters. It makes the difference
    between the *source* and the *target* language.
  * For convenience, ``-`` can be used instead of ``auto`` as the source
    language.
  * If both grammars ``B`` and ``C`` are used in the same argument, ``C``
    prevails.
  * If a source/target language code specified via this grammar is unknown, no
    warning message is issued and item's code will silently be used. However it
    is possible to check what language code have been used in a particular query
    by having a look at item's description line.
