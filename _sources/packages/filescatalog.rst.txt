====================
FilesCatalog Package
====================

Available since version 2.16

A package to catalog the content of your filesystem in a fine-grained fashion.

It allows to quickly access specific files and/or applications **you frequently
use** without needing a third-party software like the :doc:`everything` does.

.. note::
    * This package is addressed to advanced users (read more below)
    * If you are looking for a way to browse the file system as you type a path,
      check out the :doc:`filebrowser`
    * If you are looking for a way to search for files regardless of their
      location, check out the :doc:`everything` (requires a third-party
      software)


Introduction
============

This package does not catalog any item by default and must be configured.

It is mainly addressed to advanced users who wish to have full control on the
content of their :term:`Catalog`. As a result, configuring it may feel like
quite a tedious task to some, in which case you are invited to either explore
the features offered by the :doc:`everything`, or ask for help in the
|chat_room|.

To get the best out of it in terms of efficiency (speed and memory), it is
important to understand the technical details exposed as comments in package's
default configuration file.

Head over to the |chat_room| if you have technical questions.
