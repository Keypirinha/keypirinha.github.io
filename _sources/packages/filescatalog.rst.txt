====================
FilesCatalog Package
====================

Available since version 2.16

A package to catalog the content of your filesystem in a fine-grained fashion.

It allows to quickly access specific files and/or applications **you frequently
use** without needing a third-party software like the :doc:`everything` does.

.. note::
    * This package is addressed to advanced users (more info below)
    * If you are looking for a way to browse the file system as you type a path,
      check out the :doc:`filebrowser`
    * If you are looking for a way to search for files regardless of their
      location, check out the :doc:`everything` (requires a third-party
      software)


Introduction
============

This package does not catalog any item by default and must be configured.

It is mainly addressed to advanced users who wish to have full control on the
content of their :term:`Catalog`. As a result, configuring it may feel like
quite a tedious task to some, in which case you may prefer to explore the
features offered by the :doc:`everything`, or ask for help in the |chat_room|.

To get the best out of it in terms of efficiency (speed and memory), it is
best to understand the technical details exposed as inline comments in the
default configuration file of the package.

Do not hesitate to head over to the |chat_room| if you have questions.


Profiles
========

The configuration of this package is profile-based. Each profile corresponds to
one scanning-then-filtering process of your files, before registering them into
|project|'s :term:`Catalog`.

Each profile has essentially the following properties:

* Its own configuration section in :file:`filescatalog.ini`
* A unique name among all the profiles. |br|
  Recommended form is to keep it without space character, in lower case except
  for the first letter of each word like in: ``MyProfile``, ``Applications``,
  ``PortableSoftwares``.
* A set of *paths* to scan
* Optionally a set of *filters* to include/exclude the scanned items according
  to their name, extension and filesystem attributes (hidden, read-only, ...),
  ...
* Optionally a base profile to inherit from. |br|
  It is convenient if you do not want to replicate in the current profile the
  values you already defined in the base profile.
* And other...
