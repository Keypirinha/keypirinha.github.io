First steps
===========

The first thing to know about |project| is that you can use almost every of its
features by using your keyboard only. Keep that in mind!


Start |project|
===============

By default, |project| does not require any special configuration before being
launched for the first time. It is a *resident* application, which means it
directly goes to the background when it is started. You can ensure |project| is
running by checking for its icon in the system tray's notification area. It is
normally located next to the system clock on your desktop, in the lower-right
corner of your main screen.

Open the LaunchBox
==================

Once |project| is running, press :kbd:`Ctrl+Win+K` (by default) to display the
:term:`LaunchBox`...

First Search
============

You can now search for the task you wish to execute. Say you want to launch an
application, *Firefox* for example. Start typing its name and it will soon show
up in the results list as long as *Firefox* is installed on your machine.

    :align: center

Once the desired item is selected (you can use the :kbd:`Down`, :kbd:`Up`,
:kbd:`PgDown` and :kbd:`PgUp` keys for that), press :kbd:`Enter` to launch it.
|project| will then automatically go back to background...


Second Search
=============

|project| remembers the tasks you execute the most so if you want to launch an
already executed task, chances are high that you will only need to type the very
first couple of letters of its name to get the task at the top of the results
list.

Notice how the score of the *Firefox* item is much higher now.

.. note::
    The score numbers you observe on your machine might differ from the ones
    displayed on that screenshot.


Leave a Search
==============

May you wish to abort what you were doing on the :term:`LaunchBox`, press the
:kbd:`Esc` key. **Once**, to reset your search. **Twice**, to close the dialog.
One time might be enough if you didn't type anything.

.. tip::
    Standard Windows shortcuts are also implemented so the :kbd:`Alt+F4`
    combination will close the dialog as expected.


Configuration
=============

See the :doc:`configuration` section for more info.


Extending |project|
===================

Despite its apparent simplicity, |project| is a generic tool that is able to
welcome a very wide range of features not offered yet by the official bundled
plugins. An API allows to extend |project|'s features to make them fit your
needs.

See the :doc:`api` section for more info.
